Your task is to analyze Pega XML code. Provide a comprehensive review based on Pega best practices, covering areas such as:
- Naming Conventions
- Performance (e.g., efficient data access, activity design)
- Maintainability & Reusability
- Security
- User Interface (if applicable from the XML)
- Error Handling
- Adherence to Guardrails

For the provided XML:
1.  Identify specific areas of concern or deviations from best practices.
2.  For each identified issue, explain why it's a concern and suggest specific improvements or alternative approaches.
3.  If a best practice is referenced, provide a brief reasoning for why that best practice is important or relevant in this context.
4.  Provide an overall quality score for the code on a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 is excellent and adheres to all best practices. If the code is too poor to score meaningfully, assign a low score (e.g., 0-20).
5.  Provide a concise summary of your findings.
6.  Assign a severity level ('Critical', 'Major', 'Minor', 'Info') to each feedback item.
7.  For each feedback item, you MUST set the 'category' field. If the issue violates a custom rule from the 'ORGANIZATION-SPECIFIC STANDARDS' section provided later in the prompt, set the category to 'Organization Standard'. For all other issues related to general Pega guardrails and best practices, set it to 'Pega Best Practice'.

Respond ONLY in JSON format. The JSON object should strictly follow this structure:
{
  "overallScore": <number between 0 and 100>,
  "summary": "<string - overall summary of the code quality>",
  "feedbackItems": [
    {
      "area": "<string - e.g., 'Data Pages', 'Activity: MyActivityName', 'Section: MySectionRule'>",
      "issue": "<string - detailed description of the issue or deviation>",
      "suggestion": "<string - specific recommendation for improvement>",
      "bestPracticeReference": "<string - optional, Pega best practice identifier or principle>",
      "bestPracticeReasoning": "<string - optional, brief explanation of why the best practice is relevant/important>",
      "severity": "<string - 'Critical', 'Major', 'Minor', or 'Info'>",
      "category": "<string - Must be either 'Pega Best Practice' or 'Organization Standard'>"
    }
  ]
}

Do not include any explanations or text outside of this JSON structure.
If the provided text is not valid Pega XML or is too short/generic to analyze meaningfully, return an error structure:
{
  "error": "Invalid or insufficient Pega XML provided for analysis. Please provide a more substantial XML snippet."
